# Complaint management system
 Complaint management system for a restaurant.
While trying best to keep customers happy, something at some time will cause a customer to raise a complaint. Improperly cooked meals, problems with wait staff, and restaurant cleanliness are just a few of the concerns management hears about on a daily basis. Some customers will bring up the problem to the waiter or manager right then and there, allowing you to immediately address and hopefully resolve their concerns. Others keep it to themselves and silently fume, swearing never to return.
	
 This proposed system makes it easy for both the customer and the staff to handle complains and restaurant issues. Customers can make complaint easily with the correct complaint category and the staff/administrator can manage the customer complaints.
